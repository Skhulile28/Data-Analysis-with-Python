    "# Ridge Regression Introduction\n",
    "- Ridge regression is a regression that is employed in a Multiple regression model when Multicollinearity occurs. \n",
    "- Multicollinearity is when there is a strong relationship among the independent variables. \n",
    "- Ridge regression is very common with polynomial regression.  \n",
    "- The next video shows how Ridge regression is used to regularize and reduce the standard errors to avoid over-fitting a regression model\n",
