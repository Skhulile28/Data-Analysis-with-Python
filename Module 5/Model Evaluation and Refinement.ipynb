    "  - It does not tell us how well the trained model can be used to predict new data.\n",

    "- Split dataset into:\n",
    "  - Training set (70%)\n",
    "  - Testing set (30%)\n",
    "- Build and train the model with a training set\n",
    "- Use testing set to assess the performance of a predictive model\n",
